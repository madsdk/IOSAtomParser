IOSAtomParser
=============

An objective c Atom feed parser implementation for iOS.

While functional, the parser in is current state is not production ready. It parses out all the information that I need for the one application that I am currently working on, while other information is simply thrown away ;-)

It should be pretty straight forward to make it parse the rest though, and I will implement that when I get the time...
