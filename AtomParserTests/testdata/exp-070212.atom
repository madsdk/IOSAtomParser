		<title type="text">iOS Revisited</title>
		<content type="html">I am a mobile gaming naysayer. I have been given too few reasons to believe my iPhone is somehow the messiah of the medium. The games on the app store lean towards brevity and shallow storytelling in general and consistently leave me feeling&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.experiencepoints.net/2010/11/app-disillusionment.html"&gt;unsatisfied&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;or even &lt;a href="http://www.popmatters.com/pm/post/144597-tiny-tower"&gt;manipulated&lt;/a&gt;. However, I will begrudgingly admit to playing an excessive amount of a few iOS games of late that I believe deserve your attention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Super Crate Box&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ZD4yK6FzPo4/TzH8mtZdsFI/AAAAAAAABW4/GpHYhcvqD-U/s1600/scb.PNG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="213" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ZD4yK6FzPo4/TzH8mtZdsFI/AAAAAAAABW4/GpHYhcvqD-U/s320/scb.PNG" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Initially a PC release, this frantically paced shooter/platformer recreates the enthralling masochism of &lt;i&gt;Super Meat Boy &lt;/i&gt;in a tiny package. In one room, with just a few platforms to navigate, enemies of various size, speed, and deadliness stream from the ceiling while you snatch up randomly spawned crates. Each crate cycles out your existing weapon for another, sometimes giving you an advantage and other times cursing you with a pea shooter when all you really wanted was a rocket launcher. Death comes frequently and inevitably, but another try at beating your crate box high score comes just as quickly. While the game relies just a tad too much on luck for my taste, and the touch-screen controls still make me cringe, &lt;i&gt;Super Crate Box &lt;/i&gt;delivers &amp;nbsp;bite-sized portions of frenzied play.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Where's My Water&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-FfTcpG5Mq2s/TzH8zbPTToI/AAAAAAAABXI/cgsLFZzZHi4/s1600/wmw.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="320" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-FfTcpG5Mq2s/TzH8zbPTToI/AAAAAAAABXI/cgsLFZzZHi4/s320/wmw.jpg" width="240" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Disney built a surprisingly rich physics-based puzzler with &lt;i&gt;Where's My Water&lt;/i&gt;. The game wraps a silly story about a bathing crocodile around seven themes stages. Like &lt;i&gt;Angry Birds&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;and numerous games like it, each stage adds a particular spin to the gameplay and unlocks an additional stage upon completion. Using the touch pad, your goal is to carve a path through dirt such that water falls into a drain pipe. Even with the addition of contaminating purple sewage, rampant mold growth, explosions, and acidic goop, delivering clean water to its destination is seldom difficult. However, capturing every rubber ducky along the way without losing a critical mass of water can demand some quick fingers and smart thinking. With too few competitors in the physics-based puzzling genre, &lt;i&gt;Where's My Water&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;easily floats to the top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Puzzlejuice&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-iYyeKlABcxE/TzH8y8_zUAI/AAAAAAAABXA/Bp5ZX0daLFU/s1600/pj.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="320" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-iYyeKlABcxE/TzH8y8_zUAI/AAAAAAAABXA/Bp5ZX0daLFU/s320/pj.jpg" width="213" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;The above games are great, but &lt;i&gt;Puzzlejuice &lt;/i&gt;is the real star on the iOS for me. The game is a wonderful combination of &lt;i&gt;Tetris&lt;/i&gt;, a match-3 game, and &lt;i&gt;Boggle&lt;/i&gt;. It might sound strange, but when playing &lt;i&gt;Puzzlejuice&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;its &amp;nbsp;simplicity beautifully locks everything into place. Like &lt;i&gt;Tetris&lt;/i&gt;, your goal is to strategically place assorted blocks and make them&amp;nbsp;disappear&amp;nbsp;before they fill your entire screen. However, instead of vanishing, lines of block only turn into letters. The blocks are all variably colored, and by clicking on three or more contiguous pieces of a color, these too turn into letters. Only by tracing your finger across letters to spell a word can you clear the board. The skills for one aspect of &lt;i&gt;Puzzlejuice &lt;/i&gt;do not fluidly transfer to another, so you will find yourself constantly shifting between ways of thinking, trying to suss out the logic of a match-3 game while scanning a wall of letters for a big word, absolutely twisting your brain into knots. The game aptly states it will "punch your brain in the face." After getting my own mind thoroughly beaten, I can only imagine the great combinations of genres that might surpass even &lt;i&gt;Puzzlejuice&lt;/i&gt;'s commendable efforts. Physics-based, platforming, crossword puzzle anyone?&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3967694277763110629-7752969869797917983?l=www.experiencepoints.net' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

		<title type="text">Gated Learning in 'Rayman Origins'</title>
		<content type="html">&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-shDysNCmTUM/Tysz0shrYPI/AAAAAAAABWw/fyuEggN0_5c/s1600/RaymaOriginsArt.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="320" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-shDysNCmTUM/Tysz0shrYPI/AAAAAAAABWw/fyuEggN0_5c/s320/RaymaOriginsArt.jpg" width="294" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;My latest PopMatters article is now live: &lt;a href="http://www.popmatters.com/pm/post/154023-/"&gt;Gated Learning in &lt;i&gt;Rayman Origins&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of my biggest complaints about &lt;i&gt;Super Mario Brothers Wii&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;was how absolutely unfriendly the game was in multiplayer. I also wrote about flawed multiplayer in &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.popmatters.com/pm/post/136043-donkey-kong-country-returns/"&gt;Donkey Kong Country&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;. I get that some people really enjoy painfully difficult platforming and feel that newcomers either pick up the pace or get out of the way. As I see it, a good multiplayer experience makes room for players with various skill levels without making them feel absolutely useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you play wither others from the very beginning, the gated learning system &lt;i&gt;Rayman Origins&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;implements can handle a lot of the multiplayer hangups of difficult platformers. While the skilled player could risk life and limb pursuing hard to reach lums (&lt;i&gt;Rayman&lt;/i&gt;'s version of coins), the second - or third, or fourth - player can traverse the map per usual. These secondary players may also feel valuable when the skilled player, trying to grab some hard to reach lum, falls to their death and has to be popped by the less skilled and inherently more cautious player. The large lum that temporarily increases the value of smaller lums can also comfort secondary players who can pick up any overlooked lums the skilled players miss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gated learning system is a remarkable and transparent learning tool. When &lt;i&gt;Origins&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;becomes truly difficult, it still may not be enough to maintain the commitment and interest of players unfamiliar with the genre. I hear three and four players can also get excessive, with the ability to attack other players becoming&amp;nbsp;immensely&amp;nbsp;frustrating. Since many of the multiplayer conundrums facing platformers are arguably behavior based, it would be interesting to see developers teach good multiplayer behavior with the same finesse they teach mechanics. This can be said regarding most multiplayer experiences for that matter. I have a feeling actual high school teachers might have a great deal to teach the games industry about wrangling players and fostering cooperative learning environments.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3967694277763110629-1867484145255093825?l=www.experiencepoints.net' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-saiRWrXwCJw/TyirG_J_icI/AAAAAAAAA6w/Oe5dxqN2Wkg/s1600/bejeweled2_wallpaper06.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="240" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-saiRWrXwCJw/TyirG_J_icI/AAAAAAAAA6w/Oe5dxqN2Wkg/s320/bejeweled2_wallpaper06.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I'm only half joking when I say that, after an hour or so of playing any game, I start to filter out a game's aesthetic layers.  If you could somehow record a real-time feed of my brain, you'd see what looks like a high-level Quake player's view: wire frames, textureless polygons, and the sound of silence.  I tend to place heavy emphasis on a game's systems, so this isn't anything surprising.  However, every once in a while I discover (in the most recent case, re-discover) a game that reminds me just how important video game aesthetics can be.  All this is just an overly-elaborate way of saying that I love &lt;i&gt;Bejeweled&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This all started when I found an &lt;a href="http://bejeweled.popcap.com/html5/0.9.12.9490/html5/Bejeweled.html"&gt;HTML5 version of&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Bejeweled&lt;/i&gt; in the Chrome store.  I apologize to those of you who clicked that link; I hope you enjoyed your productivity while it lased.  At its core &lt;i&gt;Bejeweled&lt;/i&gt; isn't that different from its great granddaddy,&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shariki"&gt;Shariki&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;: Like all match-three games, it taps into that primal urge to group similar things.  &lt;i&gt;Bejeweled&lt;/i&gt; is special because of its production values.  Does it need its slick animation, crisp sound effects, and ridiculous &lt;i&gt;Mortal Kombat&lt;/i&gt;-esque announcer?  It depends on what you think the essence of &lt;i&gt;Bejeweled&lt;/i&gt; is.  Strip away all of its slick style and you'd still have the same basic game systems, but you would lose &lt;i&gt;Bejeweled's&lt;/i&gt; personality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As silly as it sounds and as tired as the word is, I can't help but describe &lt;i&gt;Bejeweled&lt;/i&gt; as "epic."  It's flashy animation and dramatic music build a magnificent facade around its very simple rule set.  It's hard to describe something so intangible, but the fact remains that &lt;i&gt;Bejeweled&lt;/i&gt; aesthetic compels me to revisit it whenever I need my match-three fix.  There is something aesthetically pleasing about the way the gems shatter, how the lighting pieces crackle, and how huge combos seem to line up with crescendos in the game's frantic soundtrack.  I want to succeed not only to achieve a high score, but to embark upon mini match-three journeys, one minute at a time.  Without, all the flamboyant effects, I simply wouldn't care as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For mechanics-focused folks like  myself, it's important to remember that aesthetics are often powerful enough to affect the way we interact with game systems.  The way the camera subtly zooms and bobs during a swan dive in &lt;i&gt;Assassin's Creed&lt;/i&gt; still elicits a tingly feeling in my stomach.  The drive to seek out this feeling is as powerful a motivator to climb the game's many towers as any of the strategic gains such actions grant me.  Similarly, in &lt;i&gt;Flower&lt;/i&gt;, picking up petals in specific sequences yields pleasant musical tones.  Even though this doesn't add to any kind of "high score," the experience affects the way I play the game.  I learn how to navigate more precisely, testing the limits of the control system and my reflexes not only to collect the petals, but to hear the music they make.  It's an aesthetic cue that leads to a aesthetic reward, but serves to deepen my knowledge of the game's systems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trite as it may be to say, there's a reason we call them "video" games.  Were it no so ungainly, we would more accurately call them "audio/video games".  When searching for the essential features of a video game, its powerful multimedia aspects shouldn't be ignored.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking powerful, the irresistible force that is &lt;i&gt;Bejeweled&lt;/i&gt; beckons.  If the podcast doesn't go up this week, send help.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3967694277763110629-6343579299085402935?l=www.experiencepoints.net' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

		<title type="text">Strategies, Tactics, and Turnovers</title>
		<content type="html">&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-E1kVSKqxNdY/TyIGHg1Z34I/AAAAAAAAA50/cadxu2x3pcg/s1600/williams_turnover.jpeg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="200" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-E1kVSKqxNdY/TyIGHg1Z34I/AAAAAAAAA50/cadxu2x3pcg/s400/williams_turnover.jpeg" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Brace yourselves: this week at Popmatters, &lt;a href="http://www.popmatters.com/pm/post/153692-/"&gt;I'm talking about football&lt;/a&gt;.  Don't worry, I'm also talking about video games and board games.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This weekend I was able partake in all three areas: I watched the 49ers' heartbreaking loss, I played the deviously complex Game of Thrones board game, and I plugged away on a few video games I've been playing.  The combination of the three started to help me crystallize the way I think about video games as a medium in comparison to its other ludic cousins.&lt;br /&gt;This piece was a hard one, and even after trying to think it through over the past couple days, I'm not entirely happy with it.  An email exchange with my always-helpful editor, G. Christopher Williams, actually helped clarify my article's point, so I'll paraphrase my own emails here:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"Essentially, I'm trying to say that many video games are more like sports [than board games] because pressure to perform and tactical challenges can upset your strategy to a greater extent than can happen in most (all?) board games.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another good example [of the connection between video games and sports] [is] tennis: if you're serving and you fail to get the ball over the net two times in a row, your opponent gets a point.  Any tennis player worth his or her salt can easily get the ball over the net, but random mistakes, mental lapses, over-thinking their opponent's next move, even the wind can mess them up.  When this happens, their whole strategy needs to change: now that they're down a point, they might not charge the net, they might try to serve slower but more accurately, or they might have just given up the game.  The best tennis players are good at overcoming the pressure and mitigating random factors and are thus able to implement their strategy without having to worry about tactical mistakes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most board games do not, and possibly cannot, simulate the feeling of your body betraying your mind.  You're never going to throw the dice "wrong."  You're never going to have trouble playing a card; even if it is the wrong card from a strategic sense, you'll never have trouble implementing your action.  Very few games have "double faults" in the way tennis does; random bad luck is either purely random (in the form of dice rolls or random cards) or nonexistent (like in chess).  Video games with any kind of action component require at least some minimum amount of coordination between mental and physical effort, which makes them seem more like sports to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Playing a board game might elicit an emotional response], but I imagine most of the groaning comes from the strategic binds [the game] places you in, rather than the immediate challenge of making your decisions.  Now, if you had a timer that was ticking, forcing you to quickly move your pieces around the board, shuffle your cards, or count up points, I think you'd be bleeding back into sports territory, as a sloppy tactical mistake (dropping your tiles, counting incorrectly, missing a card, etc.) could compromise your strategy."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Granted, the line can get a bit murky, but I think the video game/sport relationship is understudied.  Again, this theory isn't fully formed, but I think there is something to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In any case, at least it &lt;a href="http://www.popmatters.com/pm/post/153692-/"&gt;took my mind off of the 49ers' inglorious end&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3967694277763110629-672732058712013185?l=www.experiencepoints.net' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

Katie Williams thinks so in her article that inspired this week's podcast discussion. Who built these walls? What are we losing by isolating ourselves? And most importantly, how do we tear these walls down? Join Scott and me this week while we try to answer these questions and many more. As always, we encourage you to read Katie's original piece which you can find in the show notes below. We also encourage you to share your thoughts in the comments section.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Discuss starters:&lt;br /&gt;- How relevant is &lt;i&gt;WoW&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;today?&lt;br /&gt;- Are MMOs unique enough such that they inherently exist in a walled off city?&lt;br /&gt;- What role do developers, and community managers in particular, play in fomenting conversation between games.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To listen to the podcast:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Subscribe to the EXP Podcast&lt;a href="http://itunes.apple.com/podcast/the-experience-points-podcast/id298542469"&gt;&amp;nbsp;via iTunes here&lt;/a&gt;.

		<title type="text">Ready Player Two</title>
		<content type="html">&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-GcD73AePPxI/Tx-aQGwhiXI/AAAAAAAABWc/_NmhnGl-qhA/s1600/ready_player_one_cover-image1.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="320" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-GcD73AePPxI/Tx-aQGwhiXI/AAAAAAAABWc/_NmhnGl-qhA/s320/ready_player_one_cover-image1.jpg" width="211" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;As you all know, I am a consumer of so much media I find it shocking I have enough time in the day to eat. This includes film and literature. So it is great when I can combine some aspects of one interest with another. I recently finished &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Ready-Player-One-Ernest-Cline/dp/030788743X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1327468404&amp;amp;sr=8-1"&gt;Ready Player One&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/i&gt;by Ernest Cline, and I want to share some of my thoughts on a book filled to the brim with pop-culture references. My hope is that Scott and I will discuss the book in greater detail on the podcast at some point. It rightfully stands out among other young-adult novels in its unabashed glorification of "nerdy" videogames, television, movies, books, music and more, particularly the classics (for better of worse) of the eighties. The book is of and for the first generation that grew up on videogames and therefore casts light into the cultural space from&amp;gt;whence&amp;nbsp;many of us come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To give a quick plot synopsis of the work, &lt;i&gt;Ready Player One&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;takes place in a dystopic future in which the world has fallen prey to environmental degradation, an immense economic collapse, corporate power, and a general malaise. The vast majority of citizens spend all their time hiding from reality in the OASIS, an MMO in which the laws of fictions are routinely broken and players can visit thousands of worls to have adventure, shop, or even go to school. When the game designer dies, he leaves behind a set of riddles and puzzles themed around the pop-culture artifacts of his time and promises that the winner will inherit his fortune. Ernest Cline&amp;nbsp;takes the premise of &lt;i&gt;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;and writes a love letter to the art of his era, from John Hughes'&amp;nbsp;oeuvre&amp;nbsp;to every game published for the Atari 2600.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will avoid detailing any more of the plot or themes from the book. If you are reading this blog, I assure you the book is well worth your time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is strange reading a book that feels intentionally written for you. I will admit, I was born in the early eighties, &amp;nbsp;so I was still a child when a lot of this book's cultural icons took shape. While a miss many of the book's references, most make my smile and laugh at the fondly remembered canon of my youth. &lt;i&gt;Ready Player One&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;is filled to the brim with nostalgia. Every time the protagonist casually makes a &lt;i&gt;Star Wars&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;reference or relies on &lt;i&gt;Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons &lt;/i&gt;knowledge to overcome a challenge, it feels immensely rewarding. In the real world, I carry with me a lingering sense that the media I consumed as a child was a waste of time, that my mind is filled with useless&amp;nbsp;limericks&amp;nbsp;and crudely drawn dungeon maps. In the world of &lt;i&gt;Ready Player One&lt;/i&gt;, trivial knowledge is invaluable. The book is an ultimate vindication of a youth spent in front of the television or around an arcade cabinet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet the book's protagonist is a hero because of his actions when tested, not his collection of 80s pop-culture information. Cline manages to avoid glorifying the "otaku" image of a nerdy kid isolated from the world while also praising the cultural artifacts of an era. We partake in the stories we have consumed, be they games, books, or literature, and they have rewarded a bounty of lessons and, yes, even escapism. I welcome the nostalgia of &lt;i&gt;Ready Player One&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;because it is familiar, sure, but also because it finds value in the artifacts of the past and, most importantly, it wants to share them. At times when playing a game, I am struck by a sense of eager jubilation, and I want nothing more than to share this particular moment with the world, spreading my enthusiasm for a game, a piece of writing, or even just a digital vista. Of course we cannot always do that. But &lt;i&gt;Ready Player One&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;tries anyway. It creates a world born of many of our shared experiences, a love letter meant to share an appreciation of the media that helped raise a generation.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3967694277763110629-6973521421340048412?l=www.experiencepoints.net' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

		<title type="text">Endeavor and the Economics of Slavery</title>
		<content type="html">&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-a1lf4KMdw1Y/TxiyGBeVGCI/AAAAAAAABVo/FFHIeZDQnmk/s1600/endeav4.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="240" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-a1lf4KMdw1Y/TxiyGBeVGCI/AAAAAAAABVo/FFHIeZDQnmk/s320/endeav4.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;My latest article is up on PopMatters: &lt;a href="http://www.popmatters.com/pm/post/153435-/"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Endeavor&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;and the Economics of Slavery&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I am a big fan of board games but rarely get an opportunity to discuss their design or significance in this venue. On several occasions Scott and I have discussed on the podcast whether certain game genres lend themselves better to certain experiences or messages. Board games are a fuzzy genre-like case because, theoretically, you could duplicate all the systems of a board game in a digital space. Many companies do in fact. &lt;i&gt;Apples to Apples&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;is now a video game, with significant rule changes from the card version. &lt;i&gt;Carcassone&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;is quite popular on XBLA and on the iOS as well. However, these digital versions still fail to capture the social and tactile elements of board games that fundamentally shape their play experience.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;In the case of &lt;i&gt;Endeavor&lt;/i&gt;, we can imagine a strategy game that chooses to model something like slavery in a similar fashion. But even if the rule system remained essentially the same, players may respond differently to the moral issues a model of slavery elicits. The shackles printed on the cards, for example, brought up disturbing visions of the human wrists and ankles they were meant to confine. The infamous drawing of a slave galley filled to the brim like a can of sardines came to mind, a high-school history lesson I will never shake forget. I brought my own morality to the table and I grew uncomfortable with finishing the game without first abolishing slavery.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Of course not everyone thinks twice about the moral or ethical implications of game design. I argue in the article that game designers should be less concerned about giving offense because creating offensive content might be required before we can mine historical systems for all their worth. Given the same system, perhaps digital game designers need to be more sensitive. Maybe the act of playing alone makes one less critical of a game's moral quandaries than playing with others and discussing the content as it arises. Everyone generally knows how atrocious the slave trade was, so it may not be the best example to explore how group play affects rhetorical outcomes. I would be even more interested in a game tackling the modern day slave trade. That would be truly brave game design. In the mean time, &lt;i&gt;Endeavor&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;might teach us how to approach such sensitive material, &lt;a href="http://www.popmatters.com/pm/post/153435-/"&gt;both the risks and rewards&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3967694277763110629-8479803138750357006?l=www.experiencepoints.net' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

		<title type="text">Stop SOPA and PIPA</title>
		<content type="html">&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-OnmxQYNBBfg/TxctYith5kI/AAAAAAAAA5o/5i2O81iYg5s/s1600/stop%2Bsopa.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="221" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-OnmxQYNBBfg/TxctYith5kI/AAAAAAAAA5o/5i2O81iYg5s/s400/stop%2Bsopa.jpg" width="228" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Hey folks.  As you may have heard, two pieces of disturbing legislation are currently working their way through the U.S. government.  The Stop Online Privacy Act ("SOPA") and the Preventing Real Online Threats to Economic Creativity and Theft of Intellectual Property Act ("PROTECT IP" or "PIPA") threaten to grant big media companies the power to censor the Internet, stifle innovation, and monopolize the business of creating media content.  We won't go into further detail here, but for those interested, Reddit has compiled good guides for educating yourself about the bills' various provisions and implications:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/help/faqs/sopa"&gt;SOPA FAQs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://blog.reddit.com/2012/01/technical-examination-of-sopa-and.html"&gt;A Technical Examination of SOPA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a group as diverse as the Internet's founding architects, security experts, legal scholars, major tech companies, MoveOn, The Tea Party Patriots, a host of video game companies, and millions of citizens come out in opposition of an idea, you can be certain something interesting is happening.  Like the other opponents of SOPA/PIPA, Jorge and I stand for an open Internet, free from the draconian policies big media companies wish to implement.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simply put, the kind of copyright laws SOPA supporters (which include companies like CBS and Viacom and organizations like the MPAA and the game industry's own &lt;a href="http://www.theesa.com/"&gt;ESA&lt;/a&gt;) seek would make it very hard, if not impossible, to foster the kind of creative space we have carved out here at Experience Points.  Government-endorsed censorship, blacklists, and monopolies have no place in the video game sphere, on the Internet, or any in any other realm of human culture and society.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We know how busy everyone is and how daunting such a huge task can feel, but anything you can do to resist this threat would make a difference.  &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/landing/takeaction/"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/01/how-pipa-and-sopa-violate-white-house-principles-supporting-free-speech"&gt;Electronic Frontier Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2012/01/protesting-sopa-what-you-can-do.ars"&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/a&gt; all offer good starting points for contributing to the cause.  Speaking out on these issues, petitioning your government representatives, and supporting independent media are crucial steps to take.  Whether you live in the U.S. or are one of our many international friends, this issue effects you.  Whether you do so with your voice, your political support, or your wallet, please oppose the forces that lead to this type of legislation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, we know it seems overwhelming, but we can do it.  In the face of today's protests, you can see SOPA's proponents getting worried.  &lt;a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2012/01/sopa-livesand-mpaa-calls-protests-an-abuse-of-power.ars"&gt;Shrill rhetoric is often a sign of desperation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for your help and support!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Jorge and Scott&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3967694277763110629-2556606849656730232?l=www.experiencepoints.net' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

Fear not: this isn't going to be a post dedicated to pro tips on min-maxing strawberry production (although I have some thoughts on that).  Instead, I'd like to recommend what I believe to be a quality "gateway" game for traditional players interested in social games: &lt;a href="http://apps.facebook.com/pjmonsters/bootstrap?state=t_d4bDfWExxBHymQZZW041W8ZSoM108O_OaEXtaMU_evkJ41gQUwrWlrsi__mzpJ9HevwF-cxo43c_QBHC1AejdscdffyYqnej0D_uWdLj4axRmU-jbSQ8g1PolVl8sJ_O5rfO0eObHOu4vsztY0k_nnOhBmq-L_NP_L7f7zZO8c-x4zERDRSPCkhe60onZMT8i4GKILQAmEEcW2fhJM6owTJK48U2RAkbAHqzomYD_Umv3hSGuJk7RqQ4K0oeyuVfMqDB9T-8t5fL3iZBrb3Pt88MEi0fUFjrcquFGi2vaUHH8JeoYG2AzeQarNbVlWTn5nBDiQ_YDxuCYa7Ls9xwlyKNOwotIsCOcJFzQD5N57jk_7rXhh2jTDtTZQDgctV6NDMxJzju9ty3XeXIHI_TF2LjBkyr1osQRd7kJ7nFSwRo_gDFoY6ggGRoANcT_kRfbPVi6aQmvpvfT9qpEbM2muIvUWIRFdVhg-Mzd7aUVl86dGi2gaI-r2Dtl7nPqnY40jOiW9pyWfKgUP2c0nJ2Ysoj3iWSSfjmvj2yBr2qk8joQJL32Kj_9Ud8GI4_Yn8ugdnYY7-YgEJp8L8LZTRCAkz2hj4BFMwfvs2Yjimyg8KpXvWSqhdEDwq8CbpZO07EqQzzd3lSmTkiCdRXVDRtVy16asaPfXHt6uv2L07qityTSYjNfao-kMotaRR-u2D8bOwV0E9t7F_VOzxxdHySnRCZMkZ8_yn8X8q1GR_5cmfwa5G6MGenpVwkm87x1M&amp;amp;code=AQC1mIMzt1nN-FFTtCqrroAzwF64cAjXCjZcZiUnrqH5kxe_E-w6kHRNdGs5rvxydFUL6HRVhtrv3gLUmDtxIwNJ6V1uRGk7Nn8OM2cQUEIUieDzX29fFCajz_x75I_osHGgbcWsyRwP2p7grvVG5BUuIjumphC_Yyc7kQ97Z-7_t5fuRHElFdSsl0d6wfzFUtLSx_LTOxhctugUOAYo82o4#_=_"&gt;PixelJunk Monsters Online&lt;/a&gt;.  PixelJunk Monsters Online is a clever take on a few familiar concepts and it manages to leverage its platform without indulging in the many of the more questionable habits other Facebook games exhibit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like its console counterpart, it's a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_defense"&gt;tower defense game&lt;/a&gt;, and a fairly traditional one at that.  After a round of building stationary defenses, lines of enemies with various abilities and strengths stream towards your base.  The more enemies you stop and the more upgrades you make, the higher your score.  It's a simple, yet challenging game that is well suited to leaderboard dynamics.  There is always a better, more efficient way to defend a stage and since you're playing on Facebook your friends will be able to prove it.  On-line leaderboards come naturally to Facebook and, since the game is free, it is much easier to build up a group of players to compete against.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From a mechanical perspective, I've always found tower defense games to be most enjoyable on the PC.  Being able to quickly click on defenses and areas of the map is faster with a mouse and the static playing field and cartoonish graphics don't lose their impact when played on the small screen.  Strategically queuing actions is usually the key to victory, but actively controlling your avatar to collect items before they fade away has saved me more than once.  These actions are perfectly suited to the strengths of the mouse and are not dependant on high production values.  This isn't to say that PixelJunk Monsters Online is aesthetically boring.  Q-Games brings a fittingly whimsical art and musical style that, while more cartoonish than its console counterpart, is still distinct.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I admire the game most for its ethical implementation of common Facebook game payment schemes.  Like most other Facebook games, Pixel Junk Monsters Online limits the amount of progress you can make in any one play session.  Expend all your in-game currency and you'll have to wait a few hours before you can access any new levels or search for more powerups.  "Rainbow juice" can be used to automatically open levels and can be bought with real money, but it can also be won though skilled play.  Clearing stages perfectly yields rainbow juice, which essentially means that the better you get, the more you can play.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whereas many Facebook games give you no other way to earn more currency besides begging your friends or trading it for cash, PixelJunk Monsters Online offers a proposition.  Practice, improvement, and success are rewarded by longer play times and a richer social experience (it's annoying to be bumped from the top of the leader board, regardless of whether you're king of stage 1 or 100).  Someone without a lot of money to spend won't be priced out of the game, whereas people with cash to spare have the luxury of skipping the grind if they so choose.  Either way, you have access to two legitimate ways of playing the game: you can go for high scores or push yourself to explore all the stages.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By allowing for both these options, Q-Games has made a social game that respects your time, your money, and your friends.  Instead of leveraging players and their social connections as pure assets, PixelJunk Monsters Online rewards skill as much as it does free time, money, or the number of friends you have.  At its core, it taps into an ethos that dates back to the arcades: money can buy you more time, but only practice and skill will make you better at the game and allow you secure your spot in the most enviable social position: the top of the leader board.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3967694277763110629-2951461028681505681?l=www.experiencepoints.net' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

		<title type="text">In Search of the 'Skyward Sword' Audience</title>
		<content type="html">&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-TupOYog1Eso/Tw_NHTWexjI/AAAAAAAAA5E/q6sWXj9mVPU/s1600/skyward_sword.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="160" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-TupOYog1Eso/Tw_NHTWexjI/AAAAAAAAA5E/q6sWXj9mVPU/s320/skyward_sword.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;This week at PopMatters, &lt;a href="http://www.popmatters.com/pm/post/153106-/"&gt;I take aim at &lt;i&gt;The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Zelda&lt;/i&gt; is one of my favorite series, one that I believe usually showcases the best the medium has to offer.  Over the years, &lt;i&gt;Zelda&lt;/i&gt; games have pushed design philosophy forward, implementing dynamics to which most other games still aspire.  Therefore, it brings me no pleasure to say that Skyward Sword is a disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Certainly, there are bright spots.  The world is vibrant, the art style is charming, the music is superb, and some of the motion control is enjoyable, although "some" is a very important qualifier in this case (more on that topic in the future).  Conceptually, the puzzles and secrets are as clever and inventive as ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The game's implementation is another story.  &lt;a href="http://www.experiencepoints.net/2012/01/zelda-for-two.html"&gt;As I wrote last week&lt;/a&gt;, Hanah and I are playing the game together, and our unique gripes about the game started me thinking: who is &lt;i&gt;Skyward Sword's&lt;/i&gt; intended audience?  I get exasperated by the didactic tutorial sequences, the slow storytelling pace, and the inexcusable technical snafus (such as irritating load times and weird motion control).  My wife gets irritated by the game's demanding difficulty and obscure quest design.  We are both annoyed by inexplicable rule changes and poorly telegraphed action sequences that both assume a level of familiarity with other game conventions that are neither taught to the player nor suited the franchise's historical design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Making a game for "everybody" is a dangerous course of action, but one that Nintendo probably felt compelled to pursue.  After all, the Wii's accessibility was the key to its success, so it's understandable that &lt;i&gt;Skyward Sword&lt;/i&gt; would be slowed down and simplified for an audience comprised largely of first-timers.  Simultaneously, &lt;i&gt;Zelda&lt;/i&gt; is one of the few reasons "core" gamers still come back to Nintendo year after year.  &lt;i&gt;Skyward Sword&lt;/i&gt; needed to meet their expectations as well.  Combine all this with a rapidly changing industry landscape (one that has shifted sharply away from Japanese RPGs and towards action-oriented, set piece games) and you have the recipe for an exceedingly strange brew.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Playing &lt;i&gt;Skyward Sword&lt;/i&gt; has been a mixture of pleasure, frustration, and outright confusion.  It doesn't feel like it was made for any single type of person, and thus &lt;a href="http://www.popmatters.com/pm/post/153106-/"&gt;ends up feeling like it was made for no one&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3967694277763110629-4375450616453647075?l=www.experiencepoints.net' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

		<title type="text">Some Past Reviews</title>
		<content type="html">&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-xRI3ECWS_5w/Twzq_ub1fwI/AAAAAAAABVU/PTDDiSjpics/s1600/Prof.+layton+and+the+last+specter.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="269" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-xRI3ECWS_5w/Twzq_ub1fwI/AAAAAAAABVU/PTDDiSjpics/s320/Prof.+layton+and+the+last+specter.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;As a result of a fast moving schedule and a gradual multimedia posting schedule, I have neglected to discuss three game reviews I have written over the past few months. I want to spend some time talking about writing these reviews, what thoughts went into it, and a bit about the games themselves, none of which I have yet talked about in posts or on the podcast. To read the reviews, just click on the titles. In the future, I promise to bring your attention to these posts a little sooner. If you have plated any of these, I would also love to hear your thoughts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.popmatters.com/pm/review/148991-magic-the-gathering-duels-of-the-planeswalkers-2012/"&gt;Magic The Gathering: Duels of the Planeswalkers 2012: Ascend Into Darkness&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yikes! I wrote this back in October (and wow, what a mouthful of a title).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was an interesting one to write because it brought up all my memories of playing &lt;i&gt;MtG&lt;/i&gt; back in grade school. In the seventh grade, when some of my friends started getting into recreational drug use (kids these days), I started getting into epic &lt;i&gt;Magic&lt;/i&gt; battles scheduled nearly every day in the library during lunch time. By high school I was slightly more cool, but still played with friends and even frequented weekly &lt;i&gt;Magic &lt;/i&gt;tournaments at Clark's, a comic book and game store that hosted matches in the cramped and poorly ventilated back room. I was just a kid with very little money to invest in building a solid deck, but I admired the game and its skilled players nonetheless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today I still have a hefty collection of &lt;i&gt;Magic &lt;/i&gt;cards and a favorite deck of mine I built later in life when I had some extra cash to spurge on my childhood dream. If you are ever in the Bay Area, I will absolutely play with you in person, which offers a special experience the xbla version of &lt;i&gt;Magic&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;cannot provide. That being said, the game is still as sharp as ever. Wizards of the Coast has refined the formula over the years and today, after instituting some prudent cuts into the bloated collection of rules and cards collection, still put out the best collectible card game on the market. I miss the days when I was "in it," and &lt;i&gt;Duels of the Planeswalkers&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;brings some of that back to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.popmatters.com/pm/review/150498-crimson-alliance/"&gt;Crimson Alliance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Few people enjoy writing a bad review for a game, so I will leave this part short. After writing this review, I ventured online to see what other critics thought of the game and was surprised to find a decent number of positive reviews. Where I saw a deliberate abuse of genre conventions others saw a decent four-player dungeon crawler. I understand the game might scratch an itch, but it irritates me knowing &lt;i&gt;Crimson Alliance&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;does so without trying to add upon, or even respect, the existing fantasy/dungeon-crawler formula. This is fast-food gaming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.popmatters.com/pm/review/152183-professor-layton-and-the-last-specter/"&gt;Professor Layton and the Last Specter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Playing &lt;i&gt;Professor Layton&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;always fills me with child-like wonderment. I can only equate the sensations I get from playing the series to the sensations I get from watching Studio Ghibli films. They are both otherworldly and comfortably familiar simultaneously. While &lt;i&gt;Last Specter&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;is certainly the worst in the franchise, it still delivers on tone and atmosphere familiar to &lt;i&gt;Layton &lt;/i&gt;fans. I am eager to see what Level-5 can do with the Nintendo 3DS for both their animation and their puzzle design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh. In reverence to the spirit of the &lt;i&gt;Layton &lt;/i&gt;series, I hid a simple word puzzle in the review, which made this a treat to write. See if you can figure it out.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3967694277763110629-8769763098773576457?l=www.experiencepoints.net' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

		<title type="text">Playing Dark Souls Desperate Acts and Our Shared Humanity</title>
		<content type="html">&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-OBMPunRvJJ0/TwaW3oOxjFI/AAAAAAAABVM/v_XCeh5IkAQ/s1600/DarkSoulsBonfire.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="180" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-OBMPunRvJJ0/TwaW3oOxjFI/AAAAAAAABVM/v_XCeh5IkAQ/s320/DarkSoulsBonfire.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;My latest PopMatters article is now live: &lt;a href="http://www.popmatters.com/pm/post/152823-/"&gt;Playing &lt;i&gt;Dark Souls&lt;/i&gt;: Desperate Acts and Our Shared Humanity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I almost called this article "Why Playing &lt;i&gt;Dark Souls&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;is Like Chopping Your Own Arm Off." I try to keep an inspirational tone throughout the piece, which I really do feel while playing the game. I also feel an immense amount of frustration. Most of the time my frustration stems from my own failings than the game system itself, and &amp;nbsp;more importantly, how little the game respects my time. Like its predecessor, &lt;i&gt;Dark Souls&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;lacks a pause feature. OK, I get it. I need to fully commit to playing, I cannot go in half-hearted. I respect that&amp;nbsp;philosophically. In fact, that plays right into the sensations evoked by Danny Boyle's take on Ralston's experience. Even the way I learn to defeat minions and bosses on the way to the next bonfire demands I do it all at once lest I forget.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I cannot feet &lt;i&gt;Dark Souls &lt;/i&gt;easily into my normal life. I cannot always commit to hour-long play sessions, particularly free of interruption. I might get a phone call, or have get a call from by boss, and have to frantically find a place to rest while spending every minute outside the game trying to remember the dance maneuvers that will save my life when I go back in. I am sad to admit this, but I do not think &lt;i&gt;Dark Souls&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;is a game I will finish. That being said, I welcome your pep talks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now on a slight tangent. I realize &lt;i&gt;127 Hours&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;came out awhile ago, but I found the film immensely compelling. Boyle gorgeously lavishes our human capacity to overcome challenges and even our own mistakes. I would almost call it a "feel good" movie even though it is about a man who chops his own arm off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, there are darker tales of our universal humanity. For example, &lt;i&gt;Into Thin Air&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;chronicles author Jon Krakauer's trip up Mt. Everest on which eight people lost their lives in a single night. I implore you: read this book. It will keep you thinking well after the final pages have turned. Whereas Boyle shows the human capacity to overcome great obstacles, Krakaur shows how humans can also succumb to their own egos, frailties, selfish&amp;nbsp;whims, and ignorance when faced with these same obstacles. The book frighten you with its critique of mistakes any of us could make. Indeed, we all make mistakes all the time, and in extreme circumstances, this mistakes are revealed to be monstrous and grotesque. I love &lt;i&gt;Dark Soul&lt;/i&gt;s&lt;i&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;for the universal humanity it depicts on the apex of tenacity, but I also want to clime that mountain and find only human remains, the bones of all the fools that have come before.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3967694277763110629-5817389624273217458?l=www.experiencepoints.net' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

		<title type="text">Zelda for Two</title>
		<content type="html">&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-6fNXXqKIdaM/TwPu_gaVyoI/AAAAAAAAA4s/V9ufV1tuNM8/s1600/link%2Band%2Bfi.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="400" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-6fNXXqKIdaM/TwPu_gaVyoI/AAAAAAAAA4s/V9ufV1tuNM8/s400/link%2Band%2Bfi.png" width="282" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Honestly, it took some will power to step away from &lt;i&gt;The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword&lt;/i&gt; long enough to write this.  I'll share some in-depth thoughts about the game itself and its place in the series in the coming weeks, but today I want to take a different approach.  As it stands now, it's not necessarily the game itself that keeps drawing me in, but the way I'm playing it.  For the first time ever, I'm doing a collaborative playthrough of a Zelda game.  My wife Hanah is making her first foray into the Zelda universe, while I am a grizzled veteran of the series.  Together, we make an odd couple, but our partnership has been made the experience uniquely enjoyable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you're being charitable, you could call &lt;i&gt;Skyward Sword&lt;/i&gt; rooted in tradition.  Some would argue that "repetition" is a better word.  Either way, there is little denying that Zelda games have a specific formula.  Playing with Hanah is refreshing because she hasn't grown accustomed to the formula yet.  I know that we're almost done with the first three primary dungeons and we haven't yet filled out our inventory, which means there are likely four to seven more second-wave dungeons to go.  I know exactly what happens when you catch a fairy in a bottle.  I've done the ghostly toilet paper quest before.  But to Hanah, this is all new and the novelty she experiences offers a vicarious excitement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's also nice to have someone to diffuse my nerd rage and generally jaded outlook.  Ultimately, it really doesn't matter that they Link isn't a lefty in &lt;i&gt;Skyward Sword&lt;/i&gt;, and the fact that there are hidden treasure chests all around the world is actually pretty neat.  Playing along with someone who is relatively new to the universe is an easy way to appreciate the things I usually take for granted.  Thanks to my prior knowledge, we can quickly cut through the extraneous dialogue and didactic explanations of basic moves and get back to what makes a Zelda game special: encountering the unexpected.  Thanks to Hanah's patience for questing and item collection, I've paid more attention to the crafting system than I would have on my own.  As was the case in &lt;i&gt;Twilight Princess&lt;/i&gt;, the world is crawling with insects to catch and utilize.  Thanks to my wife's interest, they are more than simply moving scenery this time around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, not everything in &lt;i&gt;Skyward Sword&lt;/i&gt; is a re-hash.  Thanks to its extensive use of motion controls, it's a new experience for even long-time Zelda players.  Testing the capabilities of the Wii Motion Plus by experimenting with the new swordplay techniques, item capabilities, and even Link's basic movement is an adventure unto itself.  Since the motion invalidates a good chunk of my prior skills, we're both analyzing the best tactics to employ.  We've already had some in-depth discussions about the game's design choices that, in retrospect, were worthy of a podcast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While &lt;i&gt;Skyward Sword&lt;/i&gt; hasn't always been the most intuitive or technically polished adventure (for example: a malfunctioning nunchuk hampered the first few hours of our journey), it has been a memorable one.  &lt;i&gt;Skyward Sword&lt;/i&gt; is a dramatic departure for the series in a variety of ways, and it's been nice to have a companion in this brave new world that has such waggle in it.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3967694277763110629-7392574777142617381?l=www.experiencepoints.net' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

		<title type="text">New Year's Resolutions, 2012</title>
		<content type="html">&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-4d309g9v3Ms/Tv0BZJEtKXI/AAAAAAAAA4g/gIG927EVy7g/s1600/bottle%2Bcat.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="320" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-4d309g9v3Ms/Tv0BZJEtKXI/AAAAAAAAA4g/gIG927EVy7g/s320/bottle%2Bcat.jpg" width="283" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;It's hard to believe that we've reached the end of another year.  For the most part, I'm happy to see it go: 2011 had more than its fair share of rough spots.  Thankfully, through all the tumult, I still had video games and a forum in which to discuss them.  It's nice to have a daily routine that is both structured and creative; something that keeps all the corners of my mind from gathering dust.  In the spirit of staving off stagnation, I always take some time at the end of the year to reevaluate what I've been doing and what I'd like to do in the next three hundred and sixty-five days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I've done this for a few years, I can also see how I've kept up with some past goals.  &lt;a href="http://www.experiencepoints.net/2010/12/new-years-resolutions-2011.html"&gt;Last year&lt;/a&gt;, I resolved to broaden my horizons regarding the types of games I played.  Additionally, I expressed my interest in venturing away from the major release track and exploring the independent and experimental game scenes.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think this plan was a success: thanks to our periodic Indie game podcasts and a concerted effort to pay attention to lesser-advertised games, I was exposed to a pretty eclectic batch of games.  &lt;i&gt;Inside a Star-filled&lt;/i&gt; was an classic shooter with a philosophical slant.  &lt;i&gt;The Cat and the Coup&lt;/i&gt; was a pleasant adventure game and a much-needed history lesson.  &lt;i&gt;Don't take it personally, babe...&lt;/i&gt; reintroduced me to interactive-fiction and reminded me how terrifying high school is.  A variety of other independent and browser-based games reminded me how varied the medium actually is and that innovation does not necessarily require millions of dollars and a huge R&amp;amp;D team.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a way, this resolution may have been too successful: I still haven't played some of the biggest mainstream games of the year.  &lt;i&gt;Skyrim&lt;/i&gt; is no where on the horizon, &lt;i&gt;Dark Souls&lt;/i&gt; has been passed by, and I just now started &lt;i&gt;Skyward Sword&lt;/i&gt;.  Within the next few weeks, I'm hoping to fill in the biggest hole in my 2011 release list: &lt;i&gt;Portal 2&lt;/i&gt;.  I played the first game over a year late, so I guess it's fitting that I neglect the second one as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All this brings me to my first resolution: to strike a balance between playing major releases and independent titles.  Both spheres are important, but I'm still trying to figure out how to balance my attention between the two of them without swinging wildly between extremes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My second resolution relates to another strange section of the video game landscape: Facebook.  As regular readers and listeners know, Jorge and I have been exploring the weird world of Facebook games recently.  Going in, I had the stereotypical prejudices of a "hardcore" gamer: Facebook "games" hardly deserved the title.  They were unethical, get rich quick schemes that extracted time and money from players without giving anything back in return.  However, after more than a month of experimenting with a small selection of games, I find some of my assumptions crumbling.  It's been nice having some of my prejudices challenged, and I'm looking forward to articulating some of my findings in the coming months by both playing more Facebook games and giving them the critical treatment most non-social games get these days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this sounds like I've gone off the deep end and joined the cult of social games, fear not.  My third resolution is squarely within the realm of "traditional" video games: I want to build a sweet gaming PC.  I haven't had a PC capable of playing games since college (and the one I had then was still a clunker), so it's been far long.  The advent of Steam and the indie scene's proliferation makes the PC the most versatile, democratic, and sophisticated gaming platform out there.  All that being said, I'm somewhat anxious about the process: it's been a long time since I've assembled computer parts myself and the freedom you gain in the PC world often comes at the expense of a console system's reliability.  It'll undoubtedly be an adventure, one I'll share with you all, regardless of how many things explode.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So there you have it: a quick recap of last year's goals and a few new ones to tackle in 2012.  Now, I'll cede the floor: Do you have any video game related New Year's resolutions?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to everyone for visiting the site.  Jorge and I look forward to seeing you in 2012 (assuming the Mayan apocalypse doesn't destroy us all)!&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3967694277763110629-4042734103881226567?l=www.experiencepoints.net' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

But recently Kirk Hamilton of Kotaku asked us all to revisit our bygone days and think about high school as an interesting setting for videogames. This week on the EXP Podcast, Scott and I put on our school colors and discuss our experiences with media set in high school and the trials and tribulations of our collective youths that might make us turn on our console to visit, of all places, our own high school experiences. We encourage you to read Kirk's original piece, which you can find in the show notes below. We also want you to leave your thoughts in the comments section below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Discussion starters:&lt;br /&gt;- What games set in high school have interested you and why?&lt;br /&gt;- What high school experiences lend themselves well to gaming?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To listen to the podcast:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Subscribe to the EXP Podcast&lt;a href="http://itunes.apple.com/podcast/the-experience-points-podcast/id298542469"&gt; via iTunes here&lt;/a&gt;.

		<content type="html">&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-aQ7g4cy-tgs/Tvq80oEcnHI/AAAAAAAABU4/la4PO2mA3u8/s1600/year+in+games.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="160" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-aQ7g4cy-tgs/Tvq80oEcnHI/AAAAAAAABU4/la4PO2mA3u8/s320/year+in+games.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;The year is coming to end. It is time to round up our top gaming experiences of 2011. Before I collect my personal favorites for the EXP Podcast or for PopMatters, I want to discuss three games that will not make my list, but nevertheless delivered some the best gaming moments I experienced this year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Assassin’s Creed: Revelations&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have shared my thoughts on both the &lt;a href="http://www.experiencepoints.net/2011/11/assassins-creep.html"&gt;terrible feature creep&lt;/a&gt; plaguing &lt;i&gt;Revelations&lt;/i&gt; and the &lt;a href="http://www.experiencepoints.net/2011/12/end-of-ezio.html"&gt;interesting narrative directions&lt;/a&gt; Ubisoft took Ezio. The single-player portion of the game differs only slightly from its predecessors and manages to mostly satisfy when not playing the irritating tower-defense components of the game. The multiplayer, however, deserts a heaping amount of praise. &lt;i&gt;Assassin’s Creed: Brotherhood&lt;/i&gt; introduced the groundbreaking game of deadly hide-and-seek in which assassin’s simultaneously hide amongst crowds of character models, some of which match their own, and stalk their prey through these same crowds, looking for the hint of bizarre movement that separates player from computer AI. I implore you: Play either &lt;i&gt;Brotherhood&lt;/i&gt;’s or &lt;i&gt;Revelations&lt;/i&gt;’ multiplayer game and experience one of the most interesting and unique competitive games available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While &lt;i&gt;Revelations&lt;/i&gt; keeps the formula relatively consistent, it does sharpen some of its features, such as refining player radar detection. It also features a traditional “deathmatch” mode, which removes the “hiding-amongst-AI-clones” element by giving players unique character models. I initially disregarded this mode as a hastily put-together addition. Now I realize it instead polishes the sensation of the hunt, requiring players use a sharp eye and quicker fingers to take down components who know exactly what the hunter looks like. &lt;i&gt;Revelations&lt;/i&gt; might not make my short list, but its multiplayer remains as rock solid as ever and one of the year’s highlights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Batman: Arkham Asylum&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rocksteady’s superhero star came out in 2009, but I failed to pick it up until just a couple months ago, so forgive me for stating the obvious: good god &lt;i&gt;Arkham Asylum&lt;/i&gt; is good. Batman is already a fascinating icon, and Rocksteady pulls few punches in treating the character as the troubled, mortal, and intelligent person he is. They also put so much care in character animations that I felt very much in control, embodying Batman perfectly. I felt more like Batman playing Arkham Asylum than I ever did dressing up as the caped crusader for Halloween. I was also enamored by the island mental institution and its brilliantly situated pathways through its ever changing landscape. I am incredibly excited to watch Nolan’s Dark Knight Rises, but not as as excited as I was to get my hands on Arkham City, which just might reappear again on a year-end list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Minecraft&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Considering I first played &lt;i&gt;Minecraft&lt;/i&gt; in 2010, I am hesitant to list the game on my own Game of the Year list. However, its official release occurred this past month, and it would be remiss to ignore what is undoubtedly a groundbreaking and phenomenal experience because of its strange release history. My highlights in the world of &lt;i&gt;Minecraft&lt;/i&gt; include frantic journeys through darkened forests looking for a trace of the signal fire above my base and wandering around an immense cave system, refusing to leave until I had lit every shadowed corner. I also spent several nights exploring multiplayer servers, most notably a scale model of J.R.R. Tolkien’s Middlearth built by committed fans and, without a hint of sarcasm, digital engineers. Today I rarely explore the cubed world of &lt;i&gt;Minecraft&lt;/i&gt;, but when I do, I spend days imagining possibilities, mapping out a gorgeous base, investigating the work of others, then becoming disheartened by all the beautiful contraptions and fantasy islands I will never create. &lt;i&gt;Minecraft&lt;/i&gt; is a world of the imaginary that takes a surprisingly large effort to shape to ones liking, but its allure is everlasting. For that alone it deserves my attention as one of the best games of the year.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3967694277763110629-5364387124815373152?l=www.experiencepoints.net' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

		<title type="text">Gamer Gifting</title>
		<content type="html">&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-9xLGHP92o9I/TvQslwr5aLI/AAAAAAAABUs/Fw7g0BLaYtM/s1600/angry-birds-beanie.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="320" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-9xLGHP92o9I/TvQslwr5aLI/AAAAAAAABUs/Fw7g0BLaYtM/s320/angry-birds-beanie.jpg" width="210" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;The holiday season has arrived! Although PopMatters is taking the week off, I thought I would spend some time here anyway to chat a bit about gift giving and receiving. As geek afficianados yourselves, surely you have received all sorts of terrible "game-related" merchandise from well-wishing friends and family - a game for a console you do not own, Lego Harry Potter, or a pair of Mario themed undergarments perhaps. Everyone underestimates the difficulty of shopping for game related gifts for the nerds in their life for several reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, we probably already own it. Have you seen the Steam sales lately? You can purchase an entire studio's backlog of games for the price of a single game. With a new deal every day, I would be surprised if failed to buy more gifts for myself this year than for my family. Also, did you hear Steam was giving away a prize that would grant the winner every single game available on steam? Yes. You read that right. All the games. Also, with all the sequels that have come out, your gift givers will surely think you already own that &lt;i&gt;Uncharted&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Gears of War&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Batman&lt;/i&gt;, etc. game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, there are so many options. More importantly, most of these options look the same. Could your grandmother tell the difference between &lt;i&gt;Brink&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Rage&lt;/i&gt;? What about &lt;i&gt;Dragon Age&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Skyrim&lt;/i&gt;? &lt;i&gt;Modern Warfare 3 &lt;/i&gt;or &lt;i&gt;Battlefield 3&lt;/i&gt;? We have said this time and again, but the industry does not make games accessible to outsiders particularly well. Even the games that stand out -&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;L.A. Noire &lt;/i&gt;or &lt;i&gt;Deus Ex: Human Revolution&lt;/i&gt;, for example - seem questionable from the perspective of someone who thinks all games feature soldiers or hopping Italians. If family member is going to blow sixty dollars on a holiday gift, they will want to be certain they are making a smart choice. You can imagine, then, why a Gamestop might scare them off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Solutions? Create a wish list, Steam and Amazon perhaps. Nothing helps a shopper more than an detailed list of gift ideas. You could also request gift cards. With so many great indie titles and DLC packs, some XBLA cash goes a long way. Alternatively, ask your friends and family to donate money to &lt;a href="http://www.childsplaycharity.org/"&gt;Child's Play&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;or another charitable organization of your choosing. Who are you kidding any way. Your backlog is big enough without adding another game to the docket. Why not share the gaming love by helping out those in need. Your last option, of course, is to acknowledge that kind thoughts from loved one's are more important. Besides, who doesn't love &lt;i&gt;Angry Birds&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;pajamas?&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3967694277763110629-545529964004773383?l=www.experiencepoints.net' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

But are all tasks created equal, or are some more important than others?  This week, inspired by Wired's two articles on mandatory missions every well-informed gamer should undertake, we discuss some of the game experiences that give us common ground.  As always, feel free to jump into the comments and share your thoughts.

		<title type="text">Favorites from Recent Years</title>
		<content type="html">It's the time of year when everyone is either putting together "best of" lists or looking forward to 2012's releases.  I'll be sharing my thoughts on both of these topics in the days to come, but today I'm going to slack off a little bit.  The subtle, yet ever-present pressure to stay abreast of the latest releases is felt most acutely during the end of the year.  Even so, I still can't help but come back to some of my favorites from recent years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;VVVVVV&lt;/b&gt;: It came out in 2010 and still manages to impress me every time I load it up.  From a design perspective, it has some of the tightest, well-executed platforming dynamics of any 2D platformer.  It's level design is inspired and the level editor lets you explore the game's surprisingly-complex dynamics.  On top of all this, it's hard to find a more rocking soundtrack:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;iframe width="420" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/sf06P-_1lkU" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;PixelJunk Eden&lt;/b&gt;: It's still my favorite PixelJunk game.  Something about the mixture of intense skill challenges, ambient music, and psychedelic continually draws me back.  It makes a certain amount of sense: the game is cyclical in nature.  You start off by collecting a single spectra, build up to five, and then go back to one on the next level.  You move by making wide, arcing jumps and spin in circles to collect points and time.  I find myself looping back to the game every few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;iframe width="420" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/d0aRTj6SdBI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Vanquish&lt;/b&gt;: Another one of my favorite games from 2010.  Despite it's fast-paced, chaotic environments, I find &lt;i&gt;Vanquish&lt;/i&gt; strangely relaxing.  Extremely precise controls and a heavy emphasis on tactics let's me achieve a flow state.  When enemies attack, I know exactly what to do and how to do it.  It's mixture of cover-based shooting and high-speed melee combat offers a compelling alternative to the &lt;i&gt;Gears of War&lt;/i&gt; school of third-person shooter design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/prYMsbY3NNU" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;New Super Mario Bros. Wii&lt;/b&gt;: New Super Mario Bros. Wii is a social game in the most traditional sense of the word.  When people come over to my house, I still try to get them to play a few levels with me.  Of course, playing &lt;i&gt;NSMBW&lt;/i&gt; will test even the strongest relationships (I'm pretty sure "assault with koopa shell" is grounds for divorce in some states).  Because of this, I usually play with my brother, as we are quite accustomed to each other's mischief.  Our current mission is to get all of the end-game stars, which means finishing multiple playthroughs while achieving objectives like finding each star coin or dying a minimum number of times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/XqOMinDz0mE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking back on this selection, I see a pretty accurate picture of my natural gaming proclivities.  When I'm looking for video game "comfort food" I turn to skill-based games that test dexterity and quick thinking.  I love games that take simple concepts and then iterate on them to find all their permutations.  Apparently, it doesn't hurt if they do so in 2D perspective either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The years have tendency to go by quickly, as do the games released each month.  Sometimes it's nice to slow down in the middle of the year-end rush, revisit some modern classics, and savor the experiences that often get left behind.  I'll go back to talking about recent games soon enough, but before I do, what are some of your favorites from recent years?&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3967694277763110629-5725245544044965622?l=www.experiencepoints.net' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

		<title type="text">Shigeru Miyamoto's Working Retirement</title>
		<content type="html">&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-2zvdNqv3se4/TurHScx5QZI/AAAAAAAAA4I/6eu-STo5hwQ/s1600/miyamoto1.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="160" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-2zvdNqv3se4/TurHScx5QZI/AAAAAAAAA4I/6eu-STo5hwQ/s320/miyamoto1.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;This week's PopMatters post is about a topic both Nintendo and I don't want to think about: &lt;a href="http://www.popmatters.com/pm/post/152419-/"&gt;Shigeru Miyamoto's retirement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I try not to get too involved in Internet kerfluffles, but last week's mini-panic about Miyamoto's possible retirement caught my eye.  For one thing, it was interesting to see Nintendo's immediate response to people's reactions.  Change is scary, and Nintendo knows it: the company was quick to reassure people that nothing was changing, that no one would ever abandon them, and that all was well in Neverland.  It's unusual for companies to make such honest requests as "Please do not be concerned," but such public exhortations become more understandable when you consider that Nintendo's stock was actually affected by what was basically a joke Miyamoto made during &lt;a href="http://www.wired.com/gamelife/2011/12/miyamoto-interview-transcript/all/1"&gt;his recent interview with Chris Kohler&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's only natural to worry about the future of storied franchises like Mario and Zelda when you hear that their creator is stepping down, but things become less worrisome when you look at the bigger picture.  For over a decade now, Miyamoto has been more of a consultant than anything else.  Judging by his comments in the interview, Miyamoto appreciates the importance of this position, and is looking to both cede authority and mentor up and coming developers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To hear Miyamoto talk about retirement is to listen to a man who sees an opportunity rather than an ending.  He mentions that he would like to be more involved in the design process, make smaller games, and work with young developers.  Sometimes, life is poetically cyclical: Miyamoto got his start in the arcades and gradually transitioned to big-budget console games.  Now, as his exit from that scene approaches, arcade-style games have experienced a resurgence thanks to the downloadable and mobile spaces.  The medium has never been more accommodating of small and experimental projects.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We may never get another &lt;i&gt;Ocarina of Time&lt;/i&gt; from Miyamoto, but based on his comments, it seems safe to assume that he isn't planning on simply walking away from video games.  His interest in pursuing smaller, more personal games and his dedication to mentoring the next generation of developers means that the medium will continue to benefit from his experience and creativity for years to come.  Miyamoto's willingness to pursue unorthodox ideas was what made his games great.  It seems fitting that his version of "retirement" holds the potential to carry on this innovative spirit.  Miyamoto defined his generation of game designers in the 1980s and 1990s.  &lt;a href="http://www.popmatters.com/pm/post/152419-/"&gt;Is it any surprise that he is trying to blaze a trail towards a new stage in life as he and his cohort approach retirement?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3967694277763110629-6946493050290279310?l=www.experiencepoints.net' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
